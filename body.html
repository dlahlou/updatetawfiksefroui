                                                   No matter what area of the body is subjected to the procedure, the contours
                                                   immediately become noticeably slimmer and more harmonious. The classic
                                                   example is what is referred to as โsaddlebagsโ, which are isolated fat pads
                                                   on the outer sides of the thighs, particularly affecting women. In this
                                                   case, neither exercising nor dieting can help. The only successful therapy
                                                   is liposuction. After the procedure, the legs look slim and you can again

                                                   removed, giving the face a more striking overall appearance. Liposuction is
                                                   also suitable to reduce and reshape the tummy, hips, bottom, breast, arms

                                                   procedure does not require drainage of the operation site by drainages and
                                                   can be performed as an outpatient procedure.

                                                   Compliance and follow up are easier, when the patients donโt suffer from
                                                   severe bruising and swelling. Even for smokers there is minimized danger of

                                                   Despite being recognized for over 70 years, lipedema is often confused with
                                                   obesity.

                                                   If left untreated, patients may suffer from a variety of health-related
                                                   problems that affect not only mobility, but also vital bodily functions.
                                                   Terms such as "kankles" for ankles, and "stove pipes" for the legs describe

                                                   The important thing to recognize about the Mommy Makeover is that just

                                                   children can have on our bodies! Thankfully, the Mommy Makeover is
                                                   customizable enough to adapt for any of these issues. No matter how

                                                   Because of changes caused by pregnancy and breast feeding, women may
                                                   wish to increase their breast volume through a breast augmentation with
                                                   an implant. Although, women who had breast augmentation prior to
                                                   pregnancy may find that their implants arenโt quite right. They might
                                                   require another breast augmentation to fix implants, and to either
                                                   increase or decrease implant size. Others might find that the volume of
                                                   the breast is fine, but the shape of the breast that has changed. These
                                                   women might want a mastopexy, also known as a breast lift, to reshape
                                                   the breast by tightening the breast tissue and the breast skin. A
                                                   breast implant may be placed at the same time as the mastopexy if an
                                                   increase in breast size is also desired.

                                                   A <u>tummy tuck</u> is an essential part of the mommy makeover. During
                                                   pregnancy, the bellyโs skin has to stretch to accommodate the growing
                                                   baby while the abdominal wall muscles have to separate and stretch
                                                   apart to allow for growth. Depending on your skin type, and how fast
                                                   you gained your pregnancy weight you might also develop stretch marks.
                                                   A tummy tuck, aka an abdominoplasty, can tighten muscle and skin while
                                                   a mini tummy tuck can tighten only either skin or muscle.
                                                   Unfortunately, while there is no magic cure for stretch marks yet,
                                                   tightening the surrounding skin using a tummy tuck may help their
                                                   appearance.

                                                   because after pregnancy, many women find that they have gained new
                                                   contours, unfortunately theyโre not the good kind! We more often see
                                                   these changes in the posterior hips and sometimes the thighs.
                                                   Thankfully, these areas are very responsive to the fat reduction
                                                   techniques of liposuction. Liposuction is also great for areas like the
                                                   hips, abdomen, buttocks, thighs, knees, upper arms, chin, cheeks, and
                                                   neck.

                                                <div>During the later stages of pregnancy, it is not uncommon for the pelvis
                                                   to become congested and to cause swelling of the labia. After
                                                   pregnancy, some women find that the labia minora now hangs outside the
                                                   labia majora, causing a lot of discomfort. A        <u>procedure to โtrimโ or shorten these labia</u> can be done with any

                                                   It is important to minimize pain after surgery so that you will be able
                                                   to move around sooner and decrease problems created by lack of
                                                   mobility, sleep and eat better, and feel better sooner. Most often pain
                                                   is relieved by narcotics like morphine. These drugs act on the central
                                                   nervous system and affect the entire body. Narcotics cause unwanted
                                                   side effects of nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, drowsiness and
                                                   alteration of mental status. Local anesthetics work by blocking and
                                                   controlling pain in the area affected without narcotic side effects.

                                                   day period. Since most of the pain of a โTummy Tuckโ is due to the
                                                   suture and repair of the abdominal muscles, Dr. Tawfik injects Exparel
                                                   into the abdominal muscles that delivers a safe continuous amount of
                                                   local long acting anesthetic. Because there is less pain from the

                                                   in the healing process. Drains are typically placed post-operatively as
                                                   a means of preventing this fluid accumulation. By using TissuGlu in our

                                                   is the number one complaint of abdominoplasty patients. Instead of

Most patients can return to work after about two weeks as long as this does not require excessive lifting, pushing or pulling activity.

Our patients often feel so good after their tummy tucks that they want to do more than we recommend for post-operative activity, but remember you just had major surgery and youโll need time to heal.

                                                   <strong>Fat cells are by their very nature exceptionally fragile. Complications due to ruptured fat cells justified the poor reputation fat transplantation had at the time.</strong><br/>
                                                   The complications included inflammatory responses with dead and unhealed fatty tissue, calcifications and the formation of oil cysts.<br>
                                                   Previous procedures for fat transplantation also did not produce reliable results and as a result autologous fat transplantation was considered problematic.<br/>
                                                   We now know that the complications that used to develop (oil cysts, calcifications) were due to errors in the fat harvesting, preparation and injection back into the body. Autologous fat must be harvested, prepared and re-injected as gently as possible to achieve planned, reliable and lasting results.<br/>
                                                   In the 1980s the US plastic surgeon Sydney R. Coleman was able to harvest undamaged fat cells for the first time. Dr Coleman suctioned off body fat through needles using a gentle vacuum. This procedure lasted seven hours. The majority of the cells were damaged, and the intact cells still had to be isolated using a centrifugation procedure. But the start had been made.<br/>

Using AquaShape&trade;, the harvesting (liposuction) and the preparation of the autologous fat (without centrifugation) was decisively improved.</strong></p>

                                                <div>Cosmetic Surgeon Tawfik Sefrioui, M.D.,and the surgical team now offer breast enhancement utilizing a patientโs own harvested fat. The fat from the harvested areas is removed in a manner which screens, purifies and fortifies the harvested cells, greatly improving the chances of successful transplantation and favorable, long-lasting results.</div>
                                                <div>Early attempts at fat transfer were only moderately successful, as the harvested fat often did not โstay aliveโ through the entire transplantation process. A new medical technology has been developed which purifies and fortifies the fat with the bodyโs own stem cells (also harvested from your fat). This fat purification and fortification process greatly increases the likelihood that the fat will โtakeโ in the transplanted locations.</div>
                                                <div>One cup size at most is suggested, but the actual amount of breast enlargement will be at the doctorโs discretion (you will consult with the doctor prior to any treatments). The amount of fat available which can be injected will depend upon how much fat is harvested. Fat transfer is also especially beneficial to increase the size of one breast which is slightly smaller than the other, or to improve dimpling or other structural irregularities. If you have excess fat available after your breast enhancement procedure, there may be other body areas that can also utilize this natural fat.</div>
                                                <div>Once the harvested fat undergoes a special fortifying, purifying and condensing process, it is immediately introduced into the breasts through micro injections. This process is less invasive than if you were to receive saline breast implants, and the purified harvested fat (from your own body) is much less likely to be rejected than a foreign material. How much fat can be injected into the breasts will depend upon how much fat is harvested from the donor sites and will be at the surgeonโs discretion.</div>
                                                <div>Dr Tawfik Sefrioui offers a complimentary initial evaluation for you to meet with one of our experienced patient care coordinators at our surgical facility; the evaluation takes about an hour. You and your patient care coordinator will talk about your wants and expectations, and they will gather some basic information for Dr. Sefrioui. You will also meet with a member of our surgical staff, who can answer specific questions about the various procedures involved. You will leave with a preliminary cost estimate for your likely lipolysis and fat transfer procedures. Your medical information and staff notes will then be given to Dr. Adelglass for his assessment of whether you may be a candidate for fat transfer enhancement procedures. Once it is determined that you are probably a good candidate, you will need to come in for a surgical consultation with the surgeon himself. In your meeting with Dr. sefrioui, he will review your medical history and bring up any concerns. He will also perform a physical examination of the areas to be treated. For female patients, a female assistant will be present in the room with you during this examination. After the examination is complete, Dr. Sefrioui will create a specific surgical plan, and once you have determined you are comfortable and wish to proceed, you will then meet with our office manager to discuss financing options.</div>

                                                <div>Perhaps you have heard of the โBrazilian Butt Liftโ procedureโDr. sefrioui and the surgical team are now offering fat transfer enhancement to the buttocks area. The Dr Sefrioui natural fat transfer procedure Technique gives a very โnaturalโ looking result, which doesnโt utilize foreign implant material, but instead uses your very own body fat, harvested from other body areas, fortified, and then transplanted by micro injections into the areas where you could use a little extra volume.</div>
                                                <div>Tumescent IV sedation is generally considered to be one of the safest, and most comfortable sedation methods, and is one that Dr Sefrioui uses for many of our surgical procedures. Most patients experience no discomfort nor remember anything about the actual procedure itself. After sedation, the first part of the procedure involves a liposuction process that creates sculpted contours around the buttocks, harvesting the excess fat from the hips, waistline, back, abdomen and thighs which will be used in the transplantation (also called fat grafting) process. The fat from these โdonorโ areas is filtered, condensed, purified and fortified in a process that helps it to โtakeโ well in the transplanted areas. The liposuction and fat preparation methods used preserve the integrity of the fat cells, creating a very favorable grafting material (from your own fat). This freshly-created mixture is then immediately injected into the desired areas using tiny injections. Injecting your own purified fat back into the body through microinjections offers a much lower risk of infection or tissue rejection than introducing a foreign inplant material into the body, as is generally the case with the Brazilian โButt Liftโ procedure. The amount of fat that can be re-injected (after condensing, purifying and fortifying) will depend upon the amount of fat that can be removed in the initial lipolysis procedure.

                                                   The recovery time for fat transfer varies from patient to patient, depending upon the body areas involved and complexity of the fat harvesting procedures used. Most our patients are up and around within a day and back to their routines. Some swelling, bruising, post-surgical discomfort is normal and expected.
