						BREAST Surgery is One of the important parts of my practice, it goes from
						breast reconstructions to breast augmentations.
						<br/>In breast augmentation:<br/>
						There are two different groups of patients.<br/>
						<strong>patients unhappy with the size of their breast. </strong>
						They never developed and they've always wanted to have a fuller bust and
						more cleavage. For those patients, they need to think about breast
						augmentation. This procedure will enlarge and enhance the shape of their
						breast, we usually suggest breast enhancement with Fat transfer or
						augmentation using implants either silicone or saline.
					<br/>
					The second group of patients are those who are <strong> unhappy with the shape of their breasts.</strong> Although they
					may also be unhappy with the size of their breasts, their concern is with <strong>sagging</strong>,
						<strong>
							the shape or position of the nipple, and perhaps even unevenness
						</strong>
						.
						<br/>
					</p>
					<p>
						This unevenness is very common. As we talk to patients about breast surgery
						we try to identify which problems they have and what they would like to
						improve.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are interested in cosmetic plastic surgery procedures such as a
						breast augmentation, fat grafting, breast augmentation without implants,
						breast lift, breast reduction, or breast reconstruction, please schedule a
						personal and confidential cosmetic surgery consultation with Dr Tawfik
						Sefrioui to discuss the best option for you.

					Hormonal influences, the individual structural quality of the tissue,
					pregnancy and breastfeeding, gravity and personal lifestyle, natural ageing
					processes, etc. play a decisive role in this respect. Small or sagging
					breasts make many women feel unfeminine and incomplete, reducing their
					sexual self-esteem.

				       Natural breast augmentation with your body’s
					<strong>
						own fat may be a good option for breast enlargement in patients
						reluctant to use breast implants and who desire a natural look with
						their own tissue
					</strong>
					. Dr. Tawfik Sefrioui is one of a handful of early pioneers in this new
					technology that uses the patient’s own fat Using the WAL TECHNOLOGY to
					Harvest the best quality viable fat animated with stem cells to create a
					natural filler for breast enhancement.
				<br/>
					Many patients desiring simple breast augmentation also have anatomic
					differences in their chest wall or very thin tissues where the implant is
					likely to show through the skin. In the past, there was little a patient or
					surgeon could do to address these concerns. Now, with the use of fat
					grafting, we can shape deficiencies in the breast, address asymmetries,
					chest wall abnormalities and thin tissues at the same time as the breast
					augmentation.
					<br/>
			<br/>
					What to Expect During Recovery from Natural Breast Augmentation? A surgical
					dressing will protect your incisions. You will experience some swelling and
					bruising for several days after the breast augmentation surgery. When only
					fat is used, recovery is very quick and otherwise some mild bruising there
					is very little pain. The surgeon will also prescribe pain medication to
					ease any discomfort. After healing, your new breasts will appear natural
					and enhanced.
				<br/>
					*Breast Augmentation is a surgical procedure to increase the size of
					breasts that are small and underdeveloped, or breasts that have decreased
					in size after childbearing or weight loss. Breast augmentation can reshape
					your breasts, improve your appearance and increase your self-confidence.

                     <div>
					 The FDA recently approved a new generation of silicone gel-filled breast
					implants, so now women have a choice between silicone gel and saline breast
					implants. A variety of implant shapes are available, depending on your
					preference. Dr Tawfik will discuss with you the choice of implant and what
					size changes are possible for your body structure. There are a number of
					areas where your plastic surgeon can make an incision to insert the breast
					implants:
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						In the crease underneath your breast
					</li>
					<li>
						Along the lower edge of your areola
					</li>
					<li>

								The goals of breast lift surgery are essentially the reversal of the
								changes that have occurred with the aging process:
						
							<ol>
								<li>
									Restore the Breast to where it used to be.
								</li>
								<li>
									What I call a recompation of the breast structure. In other words, take
									a breast that has been spread out and make it firm again.
								</li>
								<li>
									Bring the nipples back to a higher position and reduce the size of the
									areolae it they have been stretched out.
								</li>
								<li>
									Restore a pleasing volume balance to the breasts so that there is a
									nice fullness in the upper portions of the breast.
								</li>
								<li>
									As much as possible produce results that last a good long time.
								</li>
							</ol>
							
								in Breast Lift procedures with and without implants the breast lift
								procedure can reshape your breasts, improve your appearance and increase
								your self-confidence. Breast Lift may be recommended if you have sagging
								breasts due to past pregnancies, genetics, or aging. Breast lift can give
								you more shapely and elevated breasts. Breast lift can also reduce the size
								of the nipple areolar complexes, and position them at the correct height.
							
						
						
						</div>
						<div>
						
								Silicone breast implants provide an immediate volume augmentation of the
								breast in addition to the lifting procedure.
								<br/><br/>
							
								<strong><u>TEAR-DROP SCARLESS BREAST LIFT</u></strong>
								<br/>	
							
								A recent innovative approach to breast lifts has been the dual plane
								technique. Dr SEFRIOUI employs this method to perform a breast lift without
								the traditional incisions mentioned previously.
								<br/>
								All that is required is a small incision in the crease under the breast.
								This is followed by a delicate partial separation of the pectoral muscle
								from the breast tissue.
								<br/>
								A “tear drop”, anatomically shaped implant is inserted to gently lift the
								breast. The result is an esthetic natural appearance without the areolar
								and vertical scars of a standard breast lift.
								<br/>
								It is, however, important to note that not all patients with droopy breasts
								are considered candidates for this technique. The best patients will have
								only a small amount of sagging which can be corrected with this operation.
								<br/>
								As is the case for all breast surgeries, the operation is performed in our

								is functional and can usually return to a desk job (usually) one week after
								the surgery.

						        The use of fat at the time of breast lift can eliminate the need for
								implants in properly selected patients while addressing the loss of
								fullness in the upper breast. At your consultation you can determine the
								lifting procedure that is best for you.
								<br/>
							
								Periareolar breast lift can help.
							<br/>
								When patients have a bit more sagginess and an implant alone will not take
							    care of the issues, we often recommend a <strong>periareolar breast lift</strong>. This operation is designed to
								lift the nipple and areola into a higher position and also provide a
								relatively small breast lift. A periareolar incision is made around the
								darker skin that surrounds the nipple and is used to lift the breast and
								nipple into a higher position with or without breast implants. In most
								cases, women with saggy breasts also have wide nipples and areolas which
								are reduced to make them more proportionate with the rest of the breast
								size. This is often the ideal incision for such a situation. Healing of
								these incisions usually proceeds smoothly with incisions becoming
								relatively undetectable to the naked eye. If a breast implant is used it
								can be placed above or below the pectoral muscle using this technique. If
								you are not sure if the periareolar breast lift is the right procedure for
								you check out the other breast lift options:
						
						</div>
						<div>
						This operation is appealing in concept because it limits the scar to a line that runs around the border of the areola. The idea is to remove an oval shaped area of skin from around the areola so that when the skin at the edge of the oval is sewed to the smaller circle formed by the areola a tightening and lifting will occur. The big problem with this technique was that the scars tended to spread because of tension. Dr. Tawfik made a wonderful contribution when he suggested weaving a purse-string suture under the skin at the border of the oval. When this is tightened and a knot is placed it brings the big oval down to the size of the smaller circle, so that healing can occur without excessive tension. You can only do a limited lift with this technique. I find it most useful for the patient who desires a small lift in combination with breast implants.

								the Breast Anatomy.and the importance of the Superficial Fascial System in
								the shape of the breast.

								<strong>The Scarless Breast lift</strong>
							<br/>
								Scarless Breast Lift – RFAL: The Art of Non-Excisional Aesthetic Surgery
								<br/>
								<br/>
									<b>
										Who is a good candidate for a Scarless Lift?
									</b>
								<br/>
								The scarless breast lift procedure is appropriate for those who need a skin
								envelope reduction of 33% or less. Patients who need a more significant
								lift will require a traditional skin excision. Patients with a small to
								medium breast size are generally better candidates than those with large,
								heavy breasts. Patients with grade I-II glandular ptosis or drooping will
								see definite improvement. With grade III ptosis, a surgical lift is needed.
							
						 </div>
						 <div>The diagrams show the difference as far as scars (surgery to remove skin)
								and needle poke-holes to insert the radiofrequency wand. While traditional
								surgery can technically achieve more lifting, it does not change the
								floppy, pendulous, and flabby character of involuted breast tissue. With
								surgery, the location of the nipple is usually better. However, the
								remaining tissue character remains unchanged. With time, recurrent sagging
								is inevitable.</div>
								<div>You will see about 10-20% improvement immediately after the scarless breast
								lift procedure. At three months, about 60-75% of the final result is
								usually present. It takes at least a year to see all of the tightening that
								will occur with a single treatment. The effects are still very visible at
								four years. At 7-10 years, a touch-up treatment may be needed.</div>
								<div>
								The scarless breast is ideal for women (or men) with grade I-II glandular
								ptosis, or drooping, in which the nipples may sit a bit low, but are not
								pointing downwards.
							  <br/>
							
								Other indications include:
							

							<ol>
								<li>
									Small breast reductions in women who have mild to moderate skin laxity
									and need a small reduction.
								</li>
								<li>
									Correction of gynecomastia in men can be performed by adding a bit of
									liposuction to the RF lift. In many cases the need for big scars or
									skin excision can be eliminated because the skin contracture generated
									by the radiofrequency energy can be substantial.
								</li>
								<li>
									Asymmetric breasts can be significantly improved with this approach.
								</li>
								<li>
									Bottoming out, or laxity of tissue below the nipple, can be
									significantly improved using the RF lift.
								</li>
								<li>
									Upper pole hollowing caused by a depression in the upper part of the
									breast can be moderately improved with RF tightening of the skin and
									soft tissue.
								</li>
								<li>
									Mild tubular breast deformities can be improved with this approach.
								</li>
								<li>
									Implant problems such as mild migration, bottoming out, a “double
									bubble” deformity, or asymmetry caused by tissue laxity +/- uneven
									tissue distribution can be improved with RF, and sometimes a bit of
									liposuction
								</li>
							</ol>
							
							</div>
								
								<div>
								The lack of “down time” and lack of significant activity restrictions
								following the procedure make the scarless breast lift an attractive option.
								Patients usually wear support for six to twelve weeks in order to reduce
								the tension on the healing tissue. Most patients report minimal discomfort
								during recovery, likely because the procedure affects the skin and
								subcutaneous levels of tissue rather than the muscle and deeper levels.
							<br/>
								We advise them to:
							
							<ul>
								<li>
									Limit their arm movement.
								</li>
								<li>
									Wait about 2 days before returning to office work if the lift only has
									been performed. With additional procedures, a week off work is
									recommended.
								</li>
								<li>
									Give it about 6-8 weeks before resuming an exercise schedule.
								</li>
							</ul>
							
								However, if you are considering a lift alone, there is only a 2 day
								recovery. In some cases, the RF-assisted scarless lift can be done under
								local anesthesia with sedation, without the need for extra expense or
								unpleasant drugs. Taking it easy after surgery is important for reducing
								bleeding, infection, and drag on the treated tissue, and for achieving the
								best results possible.
								
							</div>
								
								<div>
								In most cases, it’s one and done. We usually wait a year before considering
								a second treatment. Most commonly, this is for asymmetry that was present
								before the initial treatment. Over 90% of our patients have good results
								with a single minimally invasive scarless breast lift treatment.
								<br/><br/>
							
								*<strong><u>TEAR-DROP SCARLESS BREAST LIFT</u></strong>
								
							<br/>
								A recent innovative approach to breast lifts has been the dual plane
								technique. Dr SEFRIOUI employs this method to perform a breast lift without
								the traditional incisions mentioned previously.
							<br/>
								All that is required is a small incision in the crease under the breast.
								This is followed by a delicate partial separation of the pectoral muscle
								from the breast tissue.
						<br/>
								A “tear drop”, anatomically shaped implant is inserted to gently lift the
								breast. The result is an esthetic natural appearance without the areolar
								and vertical scars of a standard breast lift.
							<br/>
								It is, however, important to note that not all patients with droopy breasts
								are considered candidates for this technique. The best patients will have
								only a small amount of sagging which can be corrected with this operation.
							<br/>
								As is the case for all breast surgeries, the operation is performed in our
								private facility, under LOCALanesthesia associated with a Regional Block as
								a day surgery. The convalescence is very similar to that of a breast
								augmentation where there is moderate pain for 3 to 4 days but the patient
								is functional and can usually return to a desk job (usually) one week after
								the surgery.

						SINCE MY FIRST OBGYN RESIDENCY TRAINING I have been involved in the fight
						to constantly improve the surgical care we give to woman with breast
						cancer. I believe this started when I was in THE Oncology surgery training,
						in Tunisia and later in Gustave Roussy Hospital in Paris throughout my
						fellowship in Breast cancer and Reconstruction. Back then woman had the
						option of mastectomy or lumpectomy with radiation therapy; few woman were
						choosing breast reconstruction, and hardly never at the time of the
						mastectomy.
					</p>
					<p>
						As I learned to perform mastectomies I saw the importance of removing all
						the breast tissue necessary to beat the cancer, but was appalled at the
						deforming results of the surgery. In the early '90s most reconstruction was
						performed with tissue expanders as a first stage and then later replaced
						with breast implants. Throughout the remaining years of the 20th century,
						tissue flaps such as TRAM flaps, DIEP, SIEA, S-GAP and I-GAP and Latissimus
						muscle flaps gained popularity and improved the quality of breast
						reconstruction.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						However, it was the advent
						<strong>
							of the skin sparing mastectomy at the beginning of the millennium, and
							later the nipple sparing mastectomy, that completely turned things
							around
						</strong>
						. Never before had we achieved such excellent results in breast
						reconstruction as we did after these advances in mastectomies. With this
						new era in treatment of breast cancer, we were able to perform
						reconstructions with implants that began to achieve aesthetic results
						almost as good as our cosmetic procedures. The addition of autologous fat
						grafting, or liposuction from the patient injected to the reconstructed
						breast finally lead to achieving aesthetic results on per with cosmetic
						breast augmentation in many patients. I am looking forward to a future
						where we will employ the use of biologically absorbable scaffolds combined
						with fat grafting that will do away with the need for silicone implants and
						reconstruct a totally natural looking, and feeling, breast.

						breast reconstruction, or just have a question about your different breast
						procedure options, please call 0522398689 to schedule a personal and

                      <div>Mastectomy is the removal of breast tissue and is usually performed as a
						treatment for breast cancer. Dr Tawfik Sefrioui in his medical facility
						offers innovative, advanced breast surgery procedures that deliver
						unparalleled, cosmetic results — because having breast cancer doesn’t have
						to mean a loss of sexuality, femininity, self-confidence.</div>
                      <div>our philosophy is that women facing breast cancer deserve not only the most
						effective treatment to cure their cancer, but also the absolute best
						possible aesthetic results. Therefore, we perform a Nipple Sparing
						Mastectomy unless the nipple is invaded by the tumor or in some cases with
						very large breasts.</div>
                      <div>
                      	Traditionally, as part of the mastectomy, the nipple and areola were
						removed, as well as a portion of breast skin, leaving a long scar across
						the chest.
					<br/>
						In Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy, we do not remove the nipple, areola, or any
						breast skin. We spare these very important aesthetic aspects of the breast,
						and make only a small scar, which is hidden under the fold of the breast,
						similar to a breast augmentation scar.
					<br/>
						While technically more difficult to perform than traditional mastectomy,
						nipple-sparing mastectomy allows for women to have reconstructed breasts
						that look natural, normal, and even beautiful. This procedure can be
						performed on over the 95% of women whose breast cancer is not in the
						nipple.
					<br/>
						This is a safe procedure; studies have shown that preserving the nipple and
						areola does not does not negatively affect the cure rate as compared to
						removing the nipple, in fact, this technique lowers overall risk, decreases
						cost, and minimizes pain.
                      </div>
                       <div>
                       	Skin-Sparing mastectomy surgery (sometimes called breast conserving
						surgery), is performed for women who have cancer in the nipple or areola.
						In this procedure by the breast cancer surgeon, most of the breast skin is
						preserved, while the nipple, areola and breast tissue are removed.
						Retaining the skin allows for immediate reconstruction; it is performed
						with a minimal incision, allowing for an excellent cosmetic result. There
						is no measurable difference in the cure rate between the skin-sparing
						mastectomy and the traditional breast mastectomy.
                       </div>
                        <div>
                        	
						There are many benefits to the nipple-sparing mastectomy. The aesthetic
						qualities of the breasts are unchanged (and occasionally enhanced), the
						shape and size of the breasts are preserved, and the incision is hidden in
						the natural crease below the breast.
					<br/>
						In addition to preserving the look of the breast, studies have suggested
						that women who have nipple-sparing mastectomy enjoy enhanced self-image
						compared to a skin-sparing or traditional breast mastectomy. While a
						skilled plastic surgeon can construct a realistic nipple, it will not have
						the exact natural appearance of a natural nipple.
					<br/>
						To illustrate the visual difference between the two procedures, below is a
						before and after picture of a patient who underwent a nipple-sparing
						mastectomy on one breast, and a skin sparing mastectomy on the other.
                        </div>
                         <div>
                         	Studies have shown that not only is nipple-sparing mastectomy just as
						effective as traditional mastectomy, it has also been shown to provide a
						slightly better survival rate than traditional mastectomy. A literature
						review of nineteen peer-reviewed studies from 1991 to 2017 reveals that
						Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy patients were in fact <u>slightly more likely</u>
						to remain cancer free during the critical five-year post-operative period.
						The complication rate is under 8%.
                         </div>
                          <div>	At the 2015 annual ASBS (American Society of Breast Surgeons) annual
						meeting, we learned that less than 5% of breast centers offer their
						patients Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy, due to the technical difficulty of the
						technique. Even in these rare centers, fewer than 30% of women are
						considered candidates. The complication rates are high in other breast
						centers, with over 20% of patients having major issues such loss of their
						reconstructions and mastectomy flap necrosis.</div>
                           <div>As this breakthrough procedure grows in popularity, we strive to set a high
						standard for our patients. We collect quarterly data and publish annually
						every outcome, complication, and operation. Our goal is to not only perform
						the best work we can at all times, but also to raise the bar for both
					ourselves and others. It is our hope that patients everywhere will demand    <em>Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy</em>, whenever safe, and get the lowest
						complication rates possible, and the aesthetic results these brave women
						deserve.</div>
						
					<div>
						Most women with breast cancer can be offered Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy. The
						only absolute contraindication is when the nipple is involved with the
						tumor. Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy may also be contraindicated in women with
						low nipple position or very large breast size.
					</div>
				
					<div>
						Patients with the BRCA gene mutation have a high risk of developing breast
						cancer in one or both breasts. Multiple studies have assigned a 57 to 86%
						chance of developing breast cancer in women identified with the BRCA gene
						mutation. In these cases removal of both breasts before cancer is
						identified is warranted. Until genetic engineering is mastered, removal of
						the target organs at risk for cancer is the safest preventative treatment
						we currently have available. This is known as a prophylactic mastectomy.
					<br/>
						Anti-hormone treatment with Tamoxifen or Aromasin also decreases the risk
						of developing breast cancer in high-risk patients, but not as effectively
						as actually removing the breasts (50 to 70 percent with medication versus
						95 percent with surgery.)
					<br/>
						As drastic as removing “normal” breasts may sound, a prophylactic
						mastectomy procedure dramatically minimizes the risk of developing breast
						cancer in the high-risk patient. Close surveillance with exams and imaging
						studies strives to catch a cancer early. This is clearly a less aggressive
						or successful strategy.
					<br/>
						Gene-positive patients are at risk for the frequently lethal ovarian cancer
						as well, and removal of their ovaries is also recommended, as soon as they
						have completed childbearing.
					<br/>
						Other reasons that a single or double mastectomy might be a reasonable
						preventive strategy are in cases of women with invasive lobular cancer.
						These patients have a higher risk of developing a new primary cancer in the
						opposite breast than those with invasive ductal cancer.
					<br/>
						This fact coupled with the increased difficulty in identifying lobular
						cancer with diagnostic imaging such as an MRI or a mammogram, may lead a
						woman to consider bilateral preventive mastectomies. Below is a picture of
						a patient who underwent the preventive bilateral prophylactic mastectomy
						with One-Stage Breast reconstruction Picture.
					</div>
					
					
					<div>
						In women with dense or lumpy breasts, post-operative surveillance is very
						difficult and dangerous. MRI, breast ultrasound and screening mammogram
						studies in these women are difficult to interpret. Additionally, cancer
						found during surgery which was missed or underestimated by imaging studies
						would indicate that future surveillance strategies are not reliable. In
						women who have large tumors in small breasts, lumpectomy is less
						cosmetically acceptable than mastectomy with reconstruction and implants.
						Preventive mastectomy may be indicated in patients without the known BRCA
						gene mutation but with a strong family history of breast cancer and other
						risk factors.
					<br§>
						Consultation with a breast mastectomy and reconstruction is recommended to
						enable patients to explore all options available and thereby make the best
						surgical decision for their case. If a mastectomy is chosen as your breast
						cancer treatment option, you want to receive the most superior results in
						single or double mastectomy We have to offer.

						After a mastectomy, the last thing you want is yet another major surgery.
						With our BRAVA + AFT (autologous fat transfer) procedure you will not be
						cut open again. As compared to the traditional methods, this involves no

						Plus, you will keep as close to normal sensation in your breasts and
						nipples. The procedure is covered by insurance for breast cancer patients.
					  <br/>
						At our Facility we understand that the breast cancer journey is filled with
						many emotions. This is why we want to ease your mind about your breast
						reconstruction decision.
					  <br/>
						Whether you’ve had a “simple” or “total” mastectomy, modified radical
						mastectomy, radical mastectomy, partial mastectomy, or a subcutaneous
						(nipple-sparing) mastectomy, or are considering a prophylactic mastectomy,

							<b>
								1st Stage: BRAVA Expansion &amp; Fat Grafting
							</b>
						
					  <br/>
						Left: Tight mastectomy defect with transverse scar.
					  <br/>
						Center: Under the effect of BRAVA expansion the scar is pulled out, the
						skin envelope enlarges, and the tight tissues fill up with body fluids to
						turn into a looser fibrous scaffold with more blood vessels. This process
						of BRAVA-induced neoangiogenesis requires at least 10 days of expansion.
					  <br/>
						Right: Fat graft droplets are injected into the scaffold seeding it
						diffusely and evenly. The fat grafts passively fill up the expanded space.
						We cannot expect the fat graft to inflate the mastectomy defect beyond what
						was achieved with BRAVA expansion. This stage will result in a breast mound
						that is always slightly smaller than the maximal BRAVA expansion effect.
					  <br/>  <br/>
						
							<b>
								2nd Stage: Additional BRAVA Expansion &amp; Fat Grafting
							</b>
					
					  <br/>
						Left: After the first fat graft stage, we have a small breast mound often
						with residual scar from the original mastectomy still denting or tethering
						the skin.
					  <br/>
						Center: Additional BRAVA expansion pulls on the tissue to further stretch
						the scar, expand the skin envelope, and generate more space and a larger
						fibro-vascular recipient scaffold. At this stage the patient often requires
						a larger, deeper BRAVA dome to accommodate the larger breast.
					  <br/>
						Right: More fat graft droplets are meticulously seeded into the scaffold
						and survive to yield a nice breast mound.
						
					</div>
					
					
					<div>
						This woman is an ideal candidate for BRAVA + AFT breast regeneration. Her
						breasts are not radiated. She has loose mastectomy scars and ample fat.
						Since she also has bilateral defects, both breasts will regenerate
						symmetrically and we do not have to match a normal side. She is successful
						because she understands and is compliant with how BRAVA should be worn.
					</div>
					
					<div>
						After using BRAVA for 4 weeks, she has nicely expanded the mastectomy
						defects and presents for the first grafting session with “edema” breasts.
						This swelling is temporary as there aren’t any fat cells to fill up the
						stretched, loose tissues. If she stops BRAVA at this point and doesn’t have
						any fat grafts, the swelling will completely subside. Notice that while the
						left breast filled up into a nicely shaped mound, the right side is still
						dented by a transverse scar that BRAVA was unable to fully release.

						Most women are candidates for our procedure. There are only 4
						disqualifiers:
					  <br/>
						1. <strong><u>Smoking</u></strong>
						<br/>
					  
						Smokers have a poor capacity to regenerate tissue. We recommend that a
						patient stops smoking at least 2 months before the procedure and abstain
						from even a single whiff or puff throughout the process and for 3 months
						after. If she cannot comply, we cannot help her.
					  <br/>
						2.
						<strong>
							<u>Herceptin® Chemotherapy and Other Angiogenesis Inhibitors</u>
						</strong>
						<br/>
					
						These prevent the revascularization of the fat graft and lead to a poor
						outcome. We recommend the process be started about 1 month after a patient
						completes her course of Herceptin treatment.
					  <br/>
						3.
						<strong>
							<u>
								Aspirin and Other Over-the-Counter Food Supplements and Vitamins
								That May Impair Blood Clotting
							</u>
						</strong>
						<br/>
					
						We have seen disastrous results when a patient has prolonged bleeding time
						from long-term use of Omega 3 fatty acids, ginkgo biloba, garlic, ginger,
						ginseng, vitamin E, herbal tea, and green tea to name a few. It is
						imperative that the patient stops aspirin, all vitamins, and all herbal
						supplements at least 2 weeks before the procedure.
					  <br/>
						4.
						<strong>
							<u>
								Poor Understanding of the Procedure and Inability to Comply With
								the BRAVA Expansion Treatment
							</u>
						</strong>
						<br/>
					
						Individuals that can not comply with the daily use of BRAVA to assure best
						procedure results. A large part of a patient’s success is tied to proper
						usage of the BRAVA for their circumstances.
						
					</div>
					
					<div>
						The patient will then wear the external expander device called BRAVA, while
						sleeping, for 3 to 5 weeks prior to the first grafting session. BRAVA is a
						comfortable soft gel-like bra. See BRAVA page for more details. Not only
						does BRAVA expand the skin from the outside, it also has the effect of
						regenerating an edema like breast mound through the expansion of tissues
						and nerves. BRAVA also increases the blood flow to the mastectomy scar and
						improves the radiation effect. This does two important things, which are
						unique to this technique:
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							It creates an adequate vascular matrix into which the liposuctioned fat
							is later injected.
						</li>
						<li>
							It allows the patient to keep almost normal sensation in her breasts
							and nipples.
						</li>
					</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						These micro-fat grafts are harvested by gentle liposuction from the
						patient’s thighs, buttocks and stomach – wherever there is fat to spare.
					  <br/>
						Once the patient has worn the BRAVA for a few weeks, the out-patient fat
						transfer procedure is performed. Fat is removed from one area of the body
						and meticulously injected back as hundreds of tiny individual droplets at
						the breast site that has been enlarged by the BRAVA expansion. These
						micro-fat grafts are harvested by gentle liposuction from the patient’s
						thighs, buttocks and stomach – wherever there is fat to spare.
					  <br/>
						The transferred fat then survives within this matrix of tissue and the
						breast mounds are restored ‘naturally’ over the ensuing three months while
						the patient receives the benefit of liposuction. This new breast mound
						feels and looks like the patients’ very own but contains no breast tissue –
						only the transferred fat. Best of all, the mound has sensation, and the
						nipples we reconstruct look and feel normal.
					  <br/>
						We are currently able to achieve up to a small B cup natural breast filled
						with your own fat with only one small outpatient fat grafting procedure. To
						attain larger breast cup sizes, the fat grafting process usually has to be
						repeated 2-3 times over a period of 2 – 6 months.
					</div>
					
					
					<div>
						With micro-fat grafting procedure, you could be back at work within 1-2
						weeks, while a full recovery can be expected in 3 months. No morbidity, no
						foreign material, no cuts or incisions, no new scars, and the patient keeps
						near-normal sensation in her breasts. All our patients love the side
						benefit of body sculpting too.
						
					</div>
					
					<div>
						There are 3 traditional breast reconstruction alternatives. ALL involve
						major “open” surgery, which means muscle trauma and new scars.
					
					<ul>
						<li>
							The implant alternative involves the placement of a foreign object such
							as silicone or saline under the muscle and leads to an artificial
							feeling breast mound. Implants are not a permanent solution.
						</li>
						<li>
							The tram flap surgery alternative involves taking a piece of muscle and
							tissue from the back or the abdomen and using it to rebuild a breast
							mound. The surgery is extensive, it requires major incisions, a
							prolonged recovery and the result is like patch work and still often
							requires an implant.
						</li>
						<li>
							The DIEP flap procedure also involves a lengthy surgery with the
							removal of abdominal fat and skin. Though this is some of the best
							looking results, it is imperative that the procedure be done by a
							specialist expert who performs lots of these on a routine basis.
							Otherwise the morbidity, complication and failure rates are very high.
							And even the best results feel and look like patch work . This
							procedure also involves a prolonged recovery time.
						</li>
