								Hydro dissection is the key principle of the facelift concept, called the
								Aqualift.
							</p>
							<p>
								The waterjet technology offers minimal impact and collateral damage with
								powerful dissection. Using the mobilization force of the waterjet, for
								example the mandibular ligaments, that have to be dissected for a natural
								reposition of the facial structures, can be addressed with minimal risk of
								nerval irritation or damage and significantly less bleeding in comparison
								to the conventional technique with translumination. Besides the advantages
								due to the tissue selective characteristics, the dissection takes place in
								considerably faster reducing the time, the procedure requires overall.
							</p>
							<p>
								Another advantage for both the patient and the surgeon is, that the
								procedure does not require drainage of the operation site by drainages and
								can be performed as an outpatient procedure.
							</p>
							<p>
								Compliance and follow up are easier, when the patients don’t suffer from
								severe bruising and swelling. Even for smokers there is minimized danger of
								healing complications with less trauma due to the gentle waterjet
								dissection.
							</p>

							<p>
								Modern cosmetology annually provides new, increasingly unique and safe
								methods for preserving youth and beauty.A lot of high-tech devices were
								created to conduct procedures that help people to remain attractive and
								self-confident.
							</p>
							<p>
								Today, the restoration of the contour of the face and the elasticity of the
								skin are the most sought-after requests in cosmetology salons.Each new
								technique is of great interest, therefore the name "aqualifting" quickly
								appeared in the course of professionals of plastic surgeons and their
								patients.

								This is a low-traumatic, absolutely effective and safe opportunity to make
								a facelift using small water jets.This method of restoring contours and
								getting rid of wrinkles was developed by Dr. Thomas Tork.
								<strong>
									His ideas were based on the fact that if a person consists of 70% of
									water, then the restoration of the full level of metabolic processes
									with the help of liquid will help to preserve the health and youth of
								</strong>
								.
							<br/>
								Aqualifting is a much more gentle method than any surgical intervention, an
								alternative possibility to change the contouring of the face by means of
								cellular nutrition, saturation of the skin with clean moisture and
								simultaneous elimination of harmful substances from the deep layers.
							</div>
						

							<div>
								<strong>
									The essence of the method is to use thin jets of water directly under
									the skin.This is achieved by means of a specially designed apparatus
									that delivers water head through specially supplied tubes directly into
									the skin of the face through microscopic punctures, the diameter of
									which should not be more than 3 mm
								</strong>
								.
							<br/>
								The finest liquid trickles wash different layers of the skin, wash the
								ducts and lumens between the muscles.The vacuum that is drawn sucks out
								excess fatty deposits, toxins, plugs and clogs from under the skin of the
								face.
							</div>
							

							<div>
								The result of this physical impact is a noticeable reduction in body
								fat.The facial contouring is carried out due to the release of lipids and
								the energetic direct micro massage of the internal tissues of .The angle of
								the lower jaw becomes more expressive, the skin on the cheeks becomes less
								flabby, it becomes even, its color improves, and small and large wrinkled
								folds are smoothed out.
							<br/>
								Aqualifting has a minimal traumatic effect on vessels, tissues and
								cells.With its help, the superfluous, obsolete small cells of the upper
								layer of the epithelium are eliminated.The regeneration period due to the
								high cleaning of tissues is greatly reduced, so the result of the procedure
								can be seen in less than a week.
							<br/>
								Taking into account that the skin does not practically undergo surgical
								treatment, and the liquid remaining after the procedure is quickly absorbed
								by epidermal cells, recovery will be much faster.Typical for cosmetological
								interventions, negative side effects such as cuts, pain, swelling or
								bruising will be minimal
								<strong>
									.After the aqualift, no standard proportion of such rehabilitation
									cases will be required, only rest is intensive moisturizing skin care.
								</strong>
								<br/>
							<br/>
								Depending on the condition of the facial skin prior to the aqualift, the
								effect can be carried out under both local and general anesthesia.The
								decision about the type of anesthesia is also affected by the patient's
								condition and his individual physiological parameters, which are discussed
								in advance with the surgeon.
							<br/>
								The procedure is quite subtle, so it is not suitable for people with deep
								sagging and wrinkles.They will need to enroll in standard types of
								facelifts, which are simple surgical procedures.
							</div>
								
							<div>
								Any person who is dissatisfied with the state of his appearance, withering
								of the skin, the appearance of small mimic wrinkles can enroll in the
								procedure of aqualift.This method of lifting is best suited to those who
								are concerned about the problem of sagging the cheeks, the appearance of
								"flaps" and the second chin, as well as those who are worried about the
								excess fatty deposits in the cervical collar zone.
							<br/>
								Also aqualifting is suitable for those who have a tarnishing of the skin, a
								noticeable deterioration in its appearance due to frequent inflammations,
								slowing healing processes.The complete washout of toxins, fat and dead
								cells that interfere with skin nutrition and metabolic processes,
								contribute to a general improvement in the health of the upper layer of the
								epidermis and the return of former attractiveness.
							</div>
							
							<div>
								<strong>
									Despite a fairly mild effect, aqualifting has a number of
									contraindications:
								</strong>
								
							<ul>
								<li>
									psychological disorders;
								</li>
								<li>
									neuroses;
								</li>
								<li>
									diabetes mellitus;
								</li>
								<li>
									pathology of cardiac muscle and vessels of acute or chronic nature;
								</li>
								<li>
									low blood coagulability;
								</li>
								<li>
									reduced hemoglobin level;
								</li>
								<li>
									acute infections of a bacterial or viral nature;
								</li>
								<li>
									neoplasms both malignant and benign;
								</li>
								<li>
									pregnancy and lactation;
								</li>
								<li>
									age under 20 years;
								</li>
								<li>
									age after 50 years.
								</li>
							</ul>

								<strong>
									When reaching the age when the wrinkles lie deep enough, there is no
									longer any sense to perform the aqualift procedure
								</strong>
								.For skin with chronic problems, a gentle effect of water will not give a
								pronounced positive effect.
							<br/>
								It is important to remember that the procedure of aqualifting, although it
								does not require special preparation, must be necessarily agreed with the
								doctor.The specialist will help to understand whether the chosen method is
								rational in a specific clinical case, and also depending on the
								characteristics of the patient will help choose between exposure to
								purified water or additionally a solution of electrolytes.
							<br/>
								Like any procedure that is a cosmetology intervention, aqualifting is
								expensive enough for the price, therefore, in order to avoid additional
								waste and recovery, all the specialist's instructions must be followed
								before and after the braces with the help of micro water-jets.

								J-Plasma Resurfacing uses a cold plasma energy to promote skin tightening
								and rejuvenation, as well as encouraging your skin to regrow new cells.
								Utilizing ionized helium gas, Dr. Tawfik Sefrioui is able to ablate tissue
								at an extremely low, controlled temperature, this allows for minimal
								collateral damage to surrounding tissue. The technology was developed for
								controlled and precise medical applications such as removing cancerous
								lesions and was found to be beneficial in aesthetic and cosmetic practices
								due to the incredible cellular rejuvenation. This plasma is different from
								the plasma that we use for our PRP Treatments which is the platelet rich
								plasma found in our blood. With the cold plasma energy of J-Plasma Skin
								Resurfacing we can treat delicate areas such as the eyelids without causing
								damage to surrounding treatment area.
							</div>
							
							<div>
								Dr. Sefrioui and his expert team can perform your J-Plasma Skin Resurfacing
								treatment very simply as an outpatient procedure. Dr. Sefrioui uses the
								J-Plasma wand and gently "paints" the areas of the face with the cold
								plasma energy. Patients can treat the full face or target the peri-oral
								(mouth) or peri-ocular (eye) area. J-Plasma Skin Resurfacing can be added
								to any of our cosmetic procedures for remarkable results.
							</div>
							
							<div>
								Our team will assist you with all of the information you need for
								exceptional results with your J-Plasma Skin Resurfacing procedure. Dr.
								Sefrioui will address all of your concerns ahead of time and discuss what
								your desired results are. He will also explain his techniques and
								anesthesia options.
							<br/>
								Prior to your procedure, Dr. Sefrioui recommends you discontinue the use of
								products containing aspirin, garlic, ginseng, green tea and vitamin E for
								two weeks, as they may increase the risk of bruising.
							</div>
							<div>
								Dr. Sefrioui or someone from his team will check in with you after your
								treatment. Initial swelling and bruising can take two to three weeks to
								resolve, but at least several months are needed until the final result
								becomes stable. J-Plasma Skin Resurfacing can cause pinkness for six to ten
								weeks post procedure. Minor discomfort can be treated with over the counter
								Tylenol. However, if you pain is unbearable, <a href="contact.html">please call our office</a>.

								Harvesting one’s unwanted fat from one area of the body and transplanting
								it into another desired area is known as Natural Fat Transfer or Natural
								Fat Grafting. There are several methods of lipolysis fat harvesting and
								natural fat implantation, but the primary medical technology utilized by Dr
								Sefrioui for natural fat harvesting is water jet lipolysis, which removes
								your fat gently–the fat that is harvested is then ideal for fat transfer to
								other body areas.
							</div>
							
							<div>
								Since cosmetic dermal fillers were introduced, cosmetic surgeon Tawfik
								Sefrioui, M.D. has been performing a variety of filler injections beneath
								the eyes, into the nasolabial folds on either side of the mouth, and to
								plump up the lips and fill the fine lines around the lips; Dr. Sefrioui
								also trains other doctors and surgeons with his injection techniques. While
								he offers a number of great dermal fillers that can produce long-lasting,
								natural-looking results, the optimal choice of fillers is one’s very own
								fat, which is less likely to cause complications (the body recognizes it as
								its own), and your own fat can potentially last for years, or even
								permanently.
							</div>
							
							<div>
								Early medical attempts at autologous fat transplantation often created
								results that were less-than-ideal, as the fat cells were often damaged
								using the older liposuction vacuuming techniques and did not always ‘stay
								alive’ when reintroduced into the body. To be fair, surgeons did not have
								the amazing fat transfer technologies just recently introduced, nor did
								they fully understand the role of stem cells in the body. Dr. Sefrioui and
								the surgical team utilizes Water Jet Liposuction to gently harvest the fat
								from the donor body sites. The fat is then processed and purified,
								condensed and fortified with P.R.P. (Platelet-Rich Plasma), also harvested
								from the patient. This process enriches the fat to make it an ideal
								grafting substance. Chances are very low that you will have any adverse
								reaction or your body will reject your own fat–the chances are much more
								likely that you will LOVE your results–for years to come!
							</div>
							
							<div>
								Common areas of the face where natural filler can be used include the
								nasolabial folds (the deep folds on either side of the nose and mouth),
								severe under-eye troughs (often a sign of aging), the cheeks and cheek
								hollows, the lips and shallow lines around the lips. Natural fat can also
								be used to augment irregularities in the face, such as icepick acne
								scarring or to fill a dent running across the bridge of the nose.
							<br/>
								Natural fat transfer is ideal for both women and men, and creates a softer,
								more youthful and energetic appearance.

							Nowadays patients need to be a very well informed about the art of
							rhinoplasty and the different approaches of it within a matter of hours.
						 <br/>   
							Despite this, there is still a shortage of information with regard to
							rhinoplasty and the various approaches rhinoplasty surgeons use to improve
							a patient’s beauty.
						<br/>
							Little distinction and attention is given to it:
						<br/>
							There are two main ways in which surgery can be performed, and this very
							lack of information can easily lead a future rhinoplasty patient into
							having a more traumatic and unnecessary surgery if she doesn’t do enough
							homework.
						<br/>
							Scarless rhinoplasty”, is a unique surgery whereby corrections and
							enhancements of the nose are made internally through the nostrils, avoid
							the need to inflict a scar at the bottom of the nose. Enhancing and
							beautifying the nose without visible scarring and done under local
							anesthesia.
						<br/>
							Most patients recover very quickly, the following day which is important,
							because statistically speaking these patients are young, energetic, and
							very social. This enables them to perform activities of daily living
							usually on post operative day two. most patients don’t show evidence of
							having had surgery and this accommodates the needs for busy patients who
							need to return to work, school, and can’t take extended time away from
							their responsibilities. Scarless surgery coupled with decreased healing
							times, are a few of the many advantages of having closed nasal surgery.
						<br/>
							In general, most rhinoplasty surgeons offer open approaches to their
							patients. Very few surgeons in the world perform only scarless rhinoplasty”
							but the overall benefits of scarless surgery overshadow the risks of any
							other approach.
						<br/>
							surgeons are being taught how to do open Rhinoplasty only Which is
							unfortunate since the majority of patients having surgery are ideal
							candidates for scarless rhinoplasty but don’t realize that this is even an
							option.
						 <br/>
							For that reason and because of lack of information the option would
							unequivocally make the patient choose the scarless approach one hundred
							percent of the time. If given the opportunity, most women would not accept
							scarring, prolonged swelling, and bruising if they were told other options
							were available.
						</div>

						
						<div>
							* No Scarring: The chief advantage of scarless rhinoplasty is the fact that
							it leaves no disfiguring scar across the columella.
						<br/>
							* Shorter Recovery: By not damaging the columella, the nasal tissues will
							heal more quickly.
						<br/>
							* Reduced Swelling: Swelling diminishes more quickly with scarless
							rhinoplasty than with open rhinoplasty.
						<br/>
							* Significant Improvements: scarless rhinoplasty can make significant
							improvements to the structure and appearance of the nose.
						</p>

						<p>
							In a personal consultation, your doctor will evaluate the overall
							appearance of your nose, its symmetry and how it fits in with the rest of
							your facial features. Many times the doctor will find that only a minor
							adjustment is required since other areas, such as the chin or cheeks,
							reflect the the perception of nasal proportion., the clinical experience in
							producing the changes ranging from ( to complete)..............
						<br/>
							Nasal Refinement, also called rhinoplasty, is typically performed to reduce
							the overall size of the nose, reshape a tip, remove a nasal hump or improve
							a poor angle between the nose and the upper lip.
						<br/>
							Newer Scarless techniques of nasal sculpturing permit to help resolving the
							imperfections of your nose under local anesthesia with minimum downtime.

						      Chin enhancement can be as simple as adding a temporary or permanent filler or fat or more complex and even associated with underlying jaw deformities and sleep apnea. We are able to diagnose abnormalities of the jaw and make recommendations for chin enhancement after any of these medical conditions are excluded. This chin is perhaps one of the most important anatomic areas of the face and although chin implants can be an excellent choice, Because of our Scarless concept ,Scarless Suture Method can be used is to restore the natural proportions, volumes, and angles of the chin by raising the chin tissues. As a significantly less invasive procedure, where the sutures actually dissolve and are reabsorbed in the skin, the aim is to achieve better aesthetic results, with less scarring. We will present you a variety of options from simplest to most complex to accomplish your goals of chin enhancement. We are working on new innovations where your cells are combined with synthetic temporary fillers to induce soft tissue and bone formation in such a way as to regenerate the aging structures of the face.

								Cheek augmentation can be carried out with fillers or Enhanced Fat transfer
								using the Body-jet ( WAL Technology) to harvest fat with stem cells, but

								approach is best for your individualized needs. Often, the cheek implant is
								performed at the time of eyelid surgery or a facelift and can be inserted
								through the eyelid incision or through an incision in the mouth. The

								to restore deep and superficial fat compartment and facial volume with fat
								grafting. Dr. Tawfik work provided his Patients for using larger volumes of
								fat for replacement of lost soft tissue from aging, along with the use of
								fat derived stem cells and regenerative cells called enhanced fat for
								restoring vascularity to the aging face and reversing some of the aging
								changes in elastin and collagen fibers, the hallmark of aging. Fat and its
								component cells are now routinely used in our practice to replace and

								As a person ages, frequently facial bones begin to recede and the facial
								tissues then lose their support. This, combined with loss of elasticity
								causes the skin to begin to sag and lift more loosely. Skin folds become
								more prominent around the chin, neck and jaw line. You may be interested in
								learning more about a face lift whenever these changes become a concern and
								your cosmetic surgeon recognizes opportunity for improvement. A face lift
								can restore your sagging skin to its earlier position, tighten the face and
								neck and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. It can bring back a more
								youthful appearance and boost self-esteem. The results of surgery can be
								dramatic for the older patient and more subtle but very satisfying for the
								younger patient.

								You may also notice laxity of upper eyelid skin and formation of bags
								beneath the eyes. Eyelid surgery can be combined with a face lift if your
								eyelids are of concern to you. A brow lift can also be combined with a face
								lift if desired. We specialize in the rejuvenation of aging facial features
								through a combination of state-of-the-art treatments and techniques totally
								customized to the individual patient’s concerns and findings. Packages are
								available that have been scientifically designed to provide the best
								outcomes from surgery or laser treatments.
							<br/>
								face lift can reverse some of the natural changes in facial appearance that
								occur with time. The natural aging process, genetic influence, sun exposure
								and other factors cause the skin of the face to wrinkle and sag.
								Understanding how aging occurs makes it simpler to understand the options
								available to prevent and treat the signs of facial aging.

								Many patients and for that matter friends tell me “they have never seen a
								good facelift”. What I tell them in return is “that is the point, you
								should not be able to tell anyone has had a facelift.”

									Ears that protrude prominently can be the cause of much
									dissatisfaction, and even great unhappiness for men and women who
									experience this condition. Prominent ear correction/reshaping, also
									known as otoplasty, is a surgical solution that can produce significant
									change in one’s appearance, and is considered one of the most
									successful cosmetic surgery procedures.
								
								<br/>
							</p>
							<p>
								The primary objective is to reduce the protrusion of the ears, and to
								provide a normal configuration when the ear is viewed from the side. This
								is achieved by modifying the flexibility of the cartilage of the ear,
								thereby altering the shape and position to a more desirable appearance.
							</p>
							<p>
								The procedure may be performed under either local anaesthetic with
								sedation, and usually takes around one hour, and is performed as a
								ambulatory surgery.
								<br/>
							</p>
							<p>
								Men and women of all ages may benefit from prominent ear correction. By
								achieving a better relationship between your ears and your face, prominent
								ear correction can improve your appearance and increase your
								self-confidence.
							</p>

							<p>
								At the time of your consultation at the Office, Dr Tawfik will discuss the
								various options available to you, in line with your specific medical
								circumstances. You should always feel free to ask your surgeon any
								questions that you have regarding the surgery, and discuss any areas that
								may seem unclear. The goal of your surgeon and the our Staff is to make
								your entire experience as comfortable, and worry-free as possible.
